// The setup routine runs once when you load the sketch or press reset:
// This is where you define pin directions
void setup()

}

// this "main" loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop()

	//Set pin 13 to HIGH. This provides 5 volts to the LED and turns it on
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
	delay(1000);	//Wait for a second
	//Set pin 13 LOW and This turns the LED off
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
	delay(1000);	//Wait for a second
